`tpyo` makes the [Alterian][0] Mediasurface 5.9.0 API easier to use.

Note that since Mediasurface is a proprietary CMS technology, you'll need to provide your own Mediasurface JARs.

Usage
=====

    MediasurfaceConfiguration newsSiteConfiguration = new MediasurfaceConfiguration.Builder()
            .serverLocation( "//10.115.40.139:2170" )
            .siteGroup( "Foo Bar Weekly" )
            .host( "news.fbw.com" )
            .usingDefaultAdminCredentials()
            .build();

    MediasurfaceOperations newsSite = new MediasurfaceTemplate(newsSiteConfiguration);

    IItem techNews = newsSite.getItemAtPath( "/articles/2012/june/tech" );

    newsSite.edit( techNews, new Editor<IItem>() {
        void edit(MediasurfaceSession session, IItem item) {
            // make changes to item: the editing workflow is handled by the template
        }
    } );

    newsSite.execute( new MediasurfaceCallback<IStatus>( ) {
        IStatus execute(MediasurfaceSession session) {
            Mediasurface mediasurface = session.getMediasurface();
            // use full mediasurface API as necessary
            return session.getNamedStatus( "Published" );
        }
    });

Tests
=====

A handful of the test fixtures are marked with [@Ignore][1]. If you want to run those test fixtures, you'll need to remove the `@Ignore` annotations and configure the `mediasurface.properties` file with the details of your CAe instances.

The test suite is written in [Groovy][2] solely because Groovy's syntactic sugar removes a lot of the ceremony in Java, leading to simpler tests that are quicker to read and write. The main code is written in Java because the team in which I was working when I wrote this library was reluctant to introduce a dependency on Groovy in production. Using Groovy just for the tests was an experiment on my part, and not a hugely successful one: the test fixtures weren't that much faster to write, and context switching between Java and Groovy was slightly annoying.
