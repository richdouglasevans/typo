typo is a small library that makes the [Alterian][0] Mediasurface 5.9.0 API easier to use.

Note that since Mediasurface is a proprietary CMS technology, you'll need to provide your own Mediasurface JARs.

Tests
=====

A handful of the test fixtures are marked with [@Ignore][1]. If you want to run those test fixtures, you'll need to remove the `@Ignore` annotations and configure the `mediasurface.properties` file with the details of your CAe instances.
